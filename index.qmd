posit::conf(2023) is an annual conference organized by [Posit](https://posit.co/) (formerly RStudio). This event is all about bringing together the community and celebrating open-source data science. You can attend the conference either in person or virtually from September 17 to September 20!

The conference program, curated by [Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz/) and the Program Committee, features over 100 engaging and thoughtful keynotes and talks. You can find the complete schedule on our [blog](https://posit.co/blog/keynotes-and-talks-at-posit-conf-2023/).

If you're not able to attend the conference in person but still want to be part of the experience, you can host or join a virtual watch party. A virtual watch party is a gathering of like-minded individuals who come together online to share the excitement and enjoy the conference together.

If you're part of a user group and would like support from Posit to host a virtual watch party, fill out the form below. We'll review your submission and get back to you shortly with more information!

We look forward to connecting with you at posit::conf(2023)!
